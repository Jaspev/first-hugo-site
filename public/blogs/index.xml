      <description>Site 1: Pretty Outside, Ugly Inside. This was my first website, made some time in late 2022. Even now I still think this website looks quite nice. It&amp;rsquo;s background would scroll, it had an animated gif with bouncing letters as the banner, the icon in the bottom right would rotate back and forth, and it even had a music player (using javascript that I stole from another site) that would play of some of my favorite music!</description>
