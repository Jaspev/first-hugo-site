Prophunt motel map with 13(?) unique rooms, bunch of secrets, easter eggs, custom textures, an error. It has it all! Actually it doesn't, I forgot to add more than 3 spawns and it's been almost a year since I made this map, so it's never getting updated. (Don't look at the comments.)

Ambient liminal space gmod map. Literally just a circle in a void. Mostly made to get back into Gmod mapping.
