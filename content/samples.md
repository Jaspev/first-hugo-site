I make audio samples sometimes, for use in music/games/whatever. File sizes are after extracting. Download links link to Mediafire. All samples are under license [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en).

14 little crunchy noise samples that are slightly tonal sometimes. Made by putting 88x11 gifs into OpenMPT. No idea how or why that makes these sounds, but I like them. So here they are.

A font(?) samplepack(?). 26 single wave audio files. Open these up in an X-Y oscilloscope and you'll see text. Made with [this web tool](http://bummsn.de/osc_txt/) that lets you draw oscilloscope shapes.
