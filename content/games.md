I actually have yet to finish a game, I've only finished one Roblox game. But I promise this page will be filled out more this year. I am currently working on a game called Pendulum!

### Aimbot Tycoon (Roblox)
A Roblox game where you have to click targets to get money, to buy upgrades for your base. I did programming and building, and my friend KomradeKat did building as well. [Play it here!](https://www.roblox.com/games/14902237854/Aimbot-Tycoon)

### Wunder (never finished)
This game never got finished. It was going to be a non-stop bullet hell that would cycle through enemies every 20 seconds, made with my friend KomradeKat. You can see it's website [here](/wunder/), and listen to it's soundtrack [here](https://youtu.be/oKjnSqHwTpg).
